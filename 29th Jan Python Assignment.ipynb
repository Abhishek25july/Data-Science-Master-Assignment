    "1-Procedural Programming: Python supports procedural programming where you can write code in a series of steps or procedures to perform specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python is a powerful object-oriented programming language. It allows you to define classes, create objects, and use inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to structure and organize code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming concepts. Functions in Python are first-class citizens, meaning you can use functions as arguments, return values, or assign them to variables. Python also includes features such as lambda functions, map, filter, and reduce for functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Imperative Programming: Python supports imperative programming, where you describe a sequence of commands for the computer to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-Declarative Programming: Although not purely declarative, Python allows some declarative programming styles, especially with libraries like NumPy and SQL Alchemy."

    "###### Automatic Memory Allocation: Python allocates memory dynamically from a private heap whenever objects (variables, lists, objects) are created.\n",

    "###### Garbage Collection: Python's garbage collector periodically identifies and removes objects that are no longer referenced (unreachable) by the program, reclaiming memory.\n",
    "###### Memory Pool Management: Python uses memory pools to efficiently allocate and deallocate memory blocks of different sizes, reducing overhead.\n",
    "###### Memory Optimizations: Python optimizes memory usage with techniques like memory reuse, object pooling, and caching (e.g., caching small integers and empty immutable objects)."
